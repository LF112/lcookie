## Story Behind LCookie
While developing the [LiCSS](https://github.com/lf112/licss) project, I would need a cookie notice banner. Despite with [@hifocus](https://github.com/hifocus)'s suggestion, I decided to turn this into a individual web component that everybody can use, with just one `.js` file and several lines of simple configurations.

## Description
 `lcookie` is a JavaScript based web component that can be easily customised and automatically shows a cookie notice banner.

 [LF112/lcookie](https://github.com/lf112/lcookie) is an open source project, released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/LF112/lcookie/blob/master/LICENSE) as a part of [LF112](https://www.lf112.net) personal project.
